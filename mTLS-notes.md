# How is mTLS different from what was described in lectures

## How does TLS work:

**Symmetric cryptography** encrypts and decrypts data with a secret key known to both sender and receiver, there can be issues with establishing a secure key.

**Asymmetric cryptography** uses two keys, a public[^1], and a private key.

# Where is mTLS frequently used

# Example application that uses mTLS

# Diagram to show the process


[^1]: Hence why this is also called public-key cryptography
