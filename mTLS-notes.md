# How is mTLS different from what was described in lectures

## How does TLS work:

**Symmetric cryptography** encrypts and decrypts data with a secret key known to both sender and receiver, there can be issues with establishing a secure key.

**Asymmetric cryptography** uses two keys, a public[^1], and a private key, these keys are related by a problem believe to be hard to reverse:
- In RSA the hardness comes from the fact that it is hard to factor large numbers
- Many modern crytography methods use arithmetic on elliptic curves points

# Example application that uses mTLS

# Diagram to show the process


[^1]: Hence why this is also called public-key cryptography
