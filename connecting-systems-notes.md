# HTTP 1.1

Hypertext - text displayed on computer displays with hyperlinks to other texts.

These hypertext documents are written in HTML and are exchanged using a certain protocol, HTTP.

HTTP began as very simple, having only one command, "GET", this would retrieve the HTML of a page a user requests using its domain name/ip address[^1].





[^1]: Recall that DNS is the "phonebook" of the internet, each device connected to the internet has its own IP address (IPv4 is 32 bit and IPv6 is 128 bit so we won't run out)
